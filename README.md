# Welcome

This the Tech Talent South GitHub Lab collaborative project for *Ruby*.  

Some of the goals of this project:

 * Teach you the basics of GitHub collaaboration
 * Teach you about merge resolution
 * Teach you about teams and project collaborators in GitHub
 * To teach you a little more about Markdown

This file is in Markdown.  You can actually edit it on your own, in your project, then when you push up to GitHub it will reflect here.  (Note: all commits have traceability so don't get nasty :smile: )

One really cool thing about Markdown is that it allows code snippets like this


```ruby
def add_this_to_that(this, that)
  sum = this + that
end
```

Cool, huh? :+1:

James Taylor in England made a live editor you can use online and copy/paste the code into your editor :boom:


Here it is:  [JBT's Live Editor](https://github.com/jbt/markdown-editor) 




### BTW, this is the stuff he used to make this:

 * [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) for Markdown parsing
 * [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) for the awesome syntax-highlighted editor
 * [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/) for syntax highlighting in output code blocks
 * [js-deflate](https://github.com/dankogai/js-deflate) for gzipping of data to make it fit in URLs
